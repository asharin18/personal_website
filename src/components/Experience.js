              I spent two summers interning at Comcast, where I worked on the
              internal alerts team for the 10G network in an agile development
              environment. For the summer of 2024, I had the opportunity to
              innovate ideas for various network signals and automate their
              integration into a data service using AWS Step Functions. I also
              contributed by building Java GraphQL resolvers and schemas to
              deliver device status updates. I also enhanced API security by
              introducing new scopes and queries, which helped prevent
              unauthorized access. During the summer of 2023, I utilized AWS
              Glue to analyze alert data and populate an AWS TimeStream table. I
              then created a Grafana time series dashboard to help improve
              data-driven decision-making. Additionally, I developed a
              Python-based Lambda for Slack messaging to handle rate limits, and
              optimized the CI/CD pipeline, resulting in time savings of up to
              30% per deployment.

        Defense is about anticipation, resiliance, and working together. Itâ€™s
        like problem-solving: spotting challenges early, staying focused, and
        finding quick solutions. Just as a strong defender can change the course
        of a game, my experiences have equipped me to navigate obstacles and
        develop creative solutions.
