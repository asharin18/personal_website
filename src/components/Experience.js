              I spent two summers interning at Comcast, where I contributed to
              the internal alerts team. Through this experience, I honed my
              problem-solving abilities by tackling a wide range of tasks and
              leveraging diverse technologies, while collaborating in an agile
              environment. Presenting projects further strengthened my
              communication skills, enabling me to convey crucial information
              effectively. Below are a few highlights from my experience:

                  and translated insights into a Grafana time series dashboard,
                  enhancing data-driven decision-making

                  service via AWS Step Function
                </li>
                <li>

        Defense is about anticipation, resiliance, and working together. Itâ€™s
        like problem-solving: spotting challenges early, staying focused, and
